# Crowdfunding-ETL
Module 8: ETL

## **Overview**

In this module we helped Independent Funding parse and clean data from crowdfunding campaigns. Specifically, the backers behind the currently live crowdfunding projects were parsed out and their emails were put into a list so that Independent Funding could contact them to help get more donations to finish the projects. We created these lists through Jupyter Notebook using Python, and then used PostgreSQL to compile the data into tables.
